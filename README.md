## üïπÔ∏è How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Pick a **topic** (Addition / Times Tables / Subtraction) and a **level**.
3. Pick a **difficulty** (Easy / Medium / Hard).
4. Answer each problem before it reaches the bottom **or** the timer expires.
5. You have a limited number of **lives** ‚ù§Ô∏è (depends on difficulty).
6. A round ends after **10 questions** or when you run out of lives.
7. Scores are recorded locally; high scores and leaderboard entries are saved per mode.

## üéöÔ∏è Difficulty Levels

Select on the Home screen (also shown as a pill in the top bar during play). Your choice is remembered.

- üü¢ **Easy** ‚Äî 5 lives, 15s per question, slower fall
- üü° **Medium** ‚Äî 3 lives, 10s per question, normal fall *(default)*
- üî¥ **Hard** ‚Äî 2 lives, 7s per question, faster fall

> Difficulty also scales the fall speed; exact values are in the code via `DIFF_SETTINGS`.

## üèÜ Leaderboard (Local)

A built-in, **local** leaderboard (using `localStorage`) stores the **Top 10** for each combination of:
- **Topic** (Addition / Times Tables / Subtraction)
- **Level** (e.g., Addition ‚â§30, 7√ó table)
- **Difficulty** (Easy / Medium / Hard)

### How it works
- At **Game Over**, if your result qualifies for the Top 10 (by **score desc**, then **faster total round time**), you‚Äôll be prompted to enter a **name/initials**.
- Click **‚ÄúSave to Leaderboard‚Äù** to record it.
- Open the **Leaderboard** from Home or the in-game HUD to browse results (filters at the top).

### Data that is saved
Each leaderboard entry stores:
- `name` (up to 20 chars)
- `score` (out of 10)
- `timeMs` (total time for the round; tie-breaker)
- `date` (unix ms)

> Your last used player name is remembered locally to speed up future saves.

## üñ•Ô∏è Code Overview

### Screens
- **Home** ‚Äî Topic cards, levels, difficulty, Leaderboard button  
- **Game** ‚Äî HUD (score, best score, difficulty pill, lives), timer bar, falling tile with answer input  
- **Game Over** ‚Äî Final score, best score, optional save area for leaderboard, quick actions  
- **Leaderboard Modal** ‚Äî Filters + Top 10 table

### Game Mechanics
- **Problem generation**
  - *Addition*: sum ‚â§ chosen cap (e.g., 30)  
  - *Times Tables*: `[level] √ó 1..12`  
  - *Subtraction*: no negative results
- **Movement**: frame-rate independent (uses delta time)
- **Timer**: per-question countdown (visual shrinking bar)
- **Lives**: lose one for wrong or missed questions
- **High score**: per mode/level (separate from the leaderboard)

### Accessibility
- Live regions for score and question counter
- Hearts labelled via ARIA with remaining lives
- Inputs labelled for screen readers

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customisation

Open `index.html` and tweak the following sections:

### Difficulty settings
```js
const DIFF_SETTINGS = {
  easy:   { lives: 5, timer: 15000, speedMul: 0.75, label: 'Easy' },
  medium: { lives: 3, timer: 10000, speedMul: 1.00, label: 'Medium' },
  hard:   { lives: 2, timer:  7000, speedMul: 1.50, label: 'Hard' }
};
